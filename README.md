# android-common
This Android-Common Project not is a true android project,because it can't run as normally.
I create it just to note the files such as common java,xml,resource ...,so that when someday I 
do the similar job,I can use it and do work well efficiently.
So I hope more and more developer can use it and fill it with more good code and others.
